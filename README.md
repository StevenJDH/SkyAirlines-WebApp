SkyAirlines is a passenger manifest management system example created to show off different technologies such as ASP.NET Core MVC 2.1+, Entity Framework Core 2.1+, Bootstrap 4+, and more. I used a Code First approach to create my domain model since EF Core doesn't support a Database First approach. The database is something I designed years ago in MySQL and then ported it to T-SQL for use in this test site. The domain model is up and running for those who want to test it out. I've included a formal way for automatically initializing the database with test data thanks to EF Core 2.1 finally including this feature. It's a lot cleaner than how it is done in EF6. The site is configured for SQL Server, so if you don't have this installed, you'll need to configure the connection string with your LocalDB instance. Remember, there is still a lot of work to do so don't expect much at this point.

View demo [here](https://stevenjdh.azurewebsites.net/Home/SkyAirlines), and click Manifests. The data will reset itself after going back to the initial SkyAirlines page.

## TODO
